## Expense Approval Workflow

### Approval Levels

| Amount           | Approval Required |
| ---------------- | ----------------- |
| < $500           | Department Head   |
| $500 - $5,000    | VP + CFO          |
| $5,000 - $25,000 | C-Suite Executive |
| > $25,000        | CEO + Board       |

### Expense Categories

- **CapEx**: Capital expenditures (equipment, software licenses > 12 months)
- **OpEx**: Operating expenses (rent, subscriptions, services)
- **COGS**: Cost of goods sold (infrastructure, payment processing)

## Budget Variance Analysis

### Variance Thresholds

- **Green**: Within ±10% of budget
- **Yellow**: 10-20% variance
- **Red**: >20% variance (requires explanation and action plan)

### Monthly Review Process

1. Collect actual spending data by category
2. Compare to budgeted amounts
3. Calculate variances
4. Identify root causes for significant variances
5. Adjust forecasts as needed
6. Create action plans for overages

## Cost Optimization Opportunities

### Identified Areas

1. **Cloud Infrastructure**: Review and optimize resource utilization (Monitor AWS/Azure costs)
2. **SaaS Subscriptions**: Audit and consolidate tools (Review GitHub, Vercel usage)
3. **Payment Processing**: Negotiate better rates based on volume (Target 2.9% → 2.5%)
4. **Personnel**: Optimize hiring plan and contractor usage (Delay hires until PMF confirmed)

### Tracking

- **Expected Savings**: $200-500/month (Post-PMF)
- **Implementation Timeline**: Ongoing
- **Status**: Monitoring phase
