- **Target Amount**: Seed Round $500,000 - $1,000,000
- **Timeline**: Q2 2026 (Target for Seed fundraising)
- **Milestone**: Complete MVP & PMF validation before seed round

### Seed Round Preparation Progress

**Investor Materials Status**:

- Financial Model: ✅ Complete (docs/finance/financial-model.md)
- Budget Framework: ✅ Complete (docs/finance/budget-tracking.md)
- Revenue Strategy: ✅ Complete (Pricing model, unit economics defined)
- Pitch Deck: 🔄 In Progress (Target: Q2 2026)
- Testimonials/Case Studies: ❌ Pending (Wait for PMF validation)

## Risk Assessment

### Financial Risks

1. **Bootstrapping Capital Limits**: Limited runway if development takes longer than expected
2. **Cloud Infrastructure Costs**: Could increase significantly with user growth (currently stable)
3. **Seed Fundraising Timing**: Market conditions may affect valuation and funding availability
4. **Test Infrastructure Delays**: CEO directive indicates test fixes are blocking progress

### Mitigation Strategies

1. Maintain strict cost control during development phase
2. Optimize cloud infrastructure usage (monitor costs daily)
3. Build MVP with clear metrics for PMF validation
4. Start investor outreach early (3-4 months before target funding date)
5. Focus on completing test infrastructure to enable feature development

### CEO Directive #001 Financial Impact

**Direct Costs**: None

**Indirect Costs**:

- Founder time investment on test fixes (opportunity cost)
- Delay in MVP development timeline (estimated 2-3 days for test fixes)
- Potential delay in PMF validation and seed fundraising timeline

**Financial Recommendation**: Acceptable trade-off. Test infrastructure stability is critical for long-term scalability and investor confidence. The delay is minimal (2-3 days) and improves code quality.

## Action Items & Decisions

### Immediate Actions

1. Continue monitoring cloud infrastructure costs daily
2. Maintain budget alerts for any unexpected cost spikes
3. Document test fix timeline for seed fundraising narrative
4. Prepare updated timeline for seed fundraising based on test infrastructure work

### Pending Approvals

- None (Bootstrapping mode - founder decisions only)

### CFO Recommendations

1. Continue bootstrapping until MVP completion
2. Align resource allocation with CEO directive #001 (test fixes priority)
3. Keep cloud infrastructure costs under $1,000/month during development
4. Prepare updated seed fundraising timeline accounting for test infrastructure work
5. Begin investor outreach by Q1 2026 (3-4 months before Q2 fundraising target)

## Integration with CEO Strategy

### Current Phase: Infrastructure Stabilization (2026-01-12 - 2026-01-14)

- **Focus**: Test infrastructure fixes, code quality, infrastructure readiness
- **Financial Impact**: Minimal - development costs already accounted for
- **Resource Allocation**: Founder time (100% on test fixes per CEO directive)

### Next Phase: MVP Development (Post-Test Fixes)

- **Focus**: Build core product features, user testing
- **Financial Impact**: Slight increase in infrastructure costs
- **Resource Allocation**: Founder time, potential freelancers if needed
- **Timeline Adjustment**: +2-3 days due to test infrastructure work

### Future Phase: PMF Validation (Q2 2026)

- **Focus**: User acquisition, feedback loop, iteration
- **Financial Impact**: Marketing spend begins (~$5,000-$10,000/month)
- **Resource Allocation**: Founder time, paid marketing channels

### Seed Round Target: Q2 2026

- **Target Raise**: $500,000 - $1,000,000
- **Runway Target**: 18-24 months
- **Use of Funds**: Product development, initial team hiring (1-2 engineers), marketing
