## Risk Assessment

### Financial Risks

2. Optimize cloud infrastructure usage (monitor costs daily)
3. Build MVP with clear metrics for PMF validation
4. Start investor outreach early (3-4 months before target funding date)

## Action Items & Decisions

### Immediate Actions

1. Monitor cloud infrastructure costs daily
2. Set up budget alerts for any unexpected cost spikes
3. Document all development assumptions for financial modeling
4. Prepare unit economics model based on proposed pricing strategy

### Pending Approvals

- None (Bootstrapping mode - founder decisions only)

### CFO Recommendations

1. Continue bootstrapping until MVP completion
2. Target seed round after demonstrating PMF
3. Focus on building core features with minimal dependencies
4. Keep cloud infrastructure costs under $1,000/month during development
5. Prepare investor pitch deck by Q2 2026
