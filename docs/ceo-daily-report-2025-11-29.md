## 🎯 Strategic Decisions Made

### **1. Infrastructure Priority Realignment**
**Decision**: Pause all feature development until critical infrastructure is stable
**Rationale**: Cannot build new features on broken foundation
**Timeline**: 48-hour emergency repair window

### **2. Resource Allocation**
**Decision**: Assign all available development resources to infrastructure repair
**Rationale**: Maximum velocity needed for critical issue resolution
**Impact**: Feature development temporarily delayed

### **3. Quality Standards Enforcement**
**Decision**: Implement zero-tolerance policy for console statements in production
**Rationale**: Security and performance best practices
**Action**: Automated linting rules to be enforced
